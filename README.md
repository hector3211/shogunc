# Shogunc

---

Shogunc is a modern, lightweight alternative to [sqlc](https://github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc) that parses raw SQL files and generates fully type-safe Go code. Designed for performance, modularity, and clarity, it gives you control over how queries are written, parsed, and mappedâ€”without sacrificing developer ergonomics.
